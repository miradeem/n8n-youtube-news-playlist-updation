# n8n-youtube-news-playlist-updation
An automated n8n workflow that monitors a YouTube playlist and automatically replaces expired live stream recordings with the latest active broadcasts via the YouTube Data API v3

I maintain a playlist on youtube that contains live streams of news channels. This playlist is then shared to the multiple screens in my household, however, I noticed that these live streams expire after a certain period of time and thus I had to manually remove the expired streams and add the latest live streams. 
Using n8n I have now automated the whole process!
